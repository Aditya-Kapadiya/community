The ABCs Assume good intentions. Be nice to each other - being civil and respectful goes a long way. Criticize code, tools, other types of contributions, and situations - not people and their personalities. Rules We respect all members of the Percona Community - that involves everyone’s contributions in code, text, visuals, and chat.</description></item><item><title>Open Topics: Blog, Talks, Guides</title><link>https://percona.community/contribute/topics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/contribute/topics/</guid><description>You can find our list of topics here.
