Proactive and reactive slow query tuning is still critical to ensure poorly written queries aren&amp;rsquo;t undermining server performance and wasting valuable compute resources. Cloud-based database managed services are not the exception: slow query root cause analysis requires human intervention. In this session I will discuss why slow query tuning is more relevant than ever, how to detect problems and guidelines to fix them.</description></item><item><title>Optimization Techniques in MySQL</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-yunus-shaikh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-yunus-shaikh/</guid><description>Optimization of mysql with indexing, server tuning and OS tuning to make performance better</description></item><item><title>Overview of Different ALTER Algorithms and Its Locking Scenarios in MySQL DEMO</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-sri-sakthivel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-sri-sakthivel/</guid><description>I would like to show the demo session on describing the different MySQL ALTER Algorithms ( COPY / INPLACE / INSTANT ) and how they are performing with different locking methods ( Exclusive / Shared / None ).</description></item><item><title>Percona Database Distributions - An Overview</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-lenz-grimmer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-lenz-grimmer/</guid><description>In this presentation, Lenz is providing an overview and update about Percona&amp;rsquo;s database distributions for MongoDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

While they elude simple computation, they are computationally expensive, involving the calculation of perhaps millions of probabilities and weights. These computations can be done outside the database, but there are specific advantages of doing machine learning inside it, close to where the data is stored.</description></item><item><title>PostgreSQL Query Performance Insights</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-hamid-akhtar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-hamid-akhtar/</guid><description>Understanding query performance patterns are essentially the foundation for query performance tuning. It, in many ways, dictates how a database cluster evolves. And then there are obviously direct and indirect cost connotations as well.
With improved observability, using the right tools, you can get the best out of your existing setup and ensure that it is able to handle not only the average load profile but peak load as well. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how different tools like pg_stat_activity, pg_stat_statements, auto_explain, pgBadger, and pg_stat_monitor can deliver a complete picture to help measure, analyze and optimize your queries and database system.</description></item><item><title>PostgreSQL Replication Conflicts: Avoiding Pitfalls</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-hamid-akhtar2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-hamid-akhtar2/</guid><description>Experiencing replication conflicts is not too unfamiliar a sight.
