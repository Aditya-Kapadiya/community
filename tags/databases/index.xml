Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you about an attempt to write my own data structure for the search (the Z-order curve) and build it into the Tarantool ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Data Wrangling With MongoDB</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-jean-joseph/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-jean-joseph/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.
