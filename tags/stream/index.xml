A common request that we get from our clients is to make MySQL highly available or to enhance existing architecture. We have standardized our approach by combining a proxy layer, for traffic redirection, a topology management tool, for master failover/switchover, and some additional tools to glue together both layers.

Regardless of development frameworks, despite linters, besides countless sessions with the DBA, slow queries always end up making it to production. Proactive and reactive slow query tuning is still critical to ensure poorly written queries aren&amp;rsquo;t undermining server performance and wasting valuable compute resources. Cloud-based database managed services are not the exception: slow query root cause analysis requires human intervention.</description></item><item><title>Optimization Techniques in MySQL</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-yunus-shaikh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-yunus-shaikh/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are intertwined capabilities that attempt to solve problems that defy traditional computational solutions &amp;mdash; problems including fraud detection, voice recognition, and search result recommendations. While they elude simple computation, they are computationally expensive, involving the calculation of perhaps millions of probabilities and weights. These computations can be done outside the database, but there are specific advantages of doing machine learning inside it, close to where the data is stored.</description></item><item><title>PostgreSQL Replication Conflicts: Avoiding Pitfalls</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-hamid-akhtar2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-hamid-akhtar2/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.
