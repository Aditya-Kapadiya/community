Following MySQL InnoDB Cluster as our first, fully integrated MySQL High Availability solution based on Group Replication, MySQL Shell 8.0.19 includes MySQL InnoDB ReplicaSet which delivers another complete solution, this time based on MySQL Replication.
The basic idea for InnoDB ReplicaSet is to do the same for classic MySQL Replication as InnoDB Cluster did for Group Replication. We take a strong technology that is very powerful but can be complex, and provide an easy-to-use AdminAPI for it in the MySQL Shell.</description></item><item><title>DBdeployer in Action - Optimised MySQL Sandboxes</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/9/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/9/</guid><description>Giuseppe Maxia and Frédéric Descamps - Oracle MySQL - MySQL Track Room - Percona Live 2021

When you have an application running in Google Kubernetes Engine, there are multiple options and considerations for how to deploy a database. In this session, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn some of the architectural considerations for choosing a database deployment option in GKE. We will demonstrate one of these options, as you learn how to configure PostgreSQL as a container in GKE based on regional persistent disks and PersistentVolumeClaims.</description></item><item><title>How To Choose the Right Solution When Lifting and Shifting Your Database to the Cloud</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/google-room/3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/google-room/3/</guid><description>Shachar Guz - Google - Percona Live 2021
Database migrations can be complex, time-consuming, and costly, increasing the risk of moving to the cloud. Enterprises need effective and reliable database migration tools that help automate this process for seamless cloud adoption. In this session, we will elaborate on the considerations to take into account when choosing database migration methods and technology, and the different aspects that can impact risk such as migration fidelity and downtime.</description></item><item><title>Validating JSON</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/8/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/8/</guid><description>Dave Stokes - Oracle MySQL - MySQL Track Room - Percona Live 2021
JSON or JavaScript Object Notation has become the data interchange format of choice. Most relational databases have added a JSON data type (Oracle, Postgresql, MySQL) or some accommodation for JSON data (SQL Server, MariaDB). But the free form nature of JSON is problematic for relational databases resulting in compromises in speed, handling of key-value pairs, and general lack of the ability to validate data.</description></item><item><title>Demystifying Database Performance Issues With SQL Commenter and Cloud SQL Insights</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/google-room/2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/google-room/2/</guid><description>Jan Kleinert - Google - Percona Live 2021
Have you ever tried to troubleshoot a database performance issue in an application that was built using an ORM? ORMs can simplify development of applications that communicate with databases, but since the ORMs are generating the SQL statements, it can be difficult to determine which application code is resulting in slow queries.
SQL Commenter is an open source library that enables ORMs to augment SQL statements with comments about the code that caused its execution, making it easier to correlate your application code with the SQL statements that were generated by the ORM.</description></item><item><title>Successfully Run Your MySQL NDB Cluster in Kubernetes</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/7/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/7/</guid><description>Tiago Alves - Oracle MySQL - MySQL Track Room - Percona Live 2021

Since 2020 the MySQL development team is offering a fully managed database service of the MySQL Enterprise Edition. Traditionally MySQL InnoDB is designed for online transaction processing (OLTP) load. MySQL can cover online analytics processing (OLAP) load, but it is often rather slow and tricky. Beginning of December 2020, the MySQL team started a second MySQL Cloud offering called MySQL HeatWave for Real-time Analytics which is based on a new in-memory analytic accelerator which has been designed for extreme performance and cloud scale.</description></item><item><title>Insights Into the New Oracle MySQL Database Service</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/2/</guid><description>Carsten Thalheimer - Oracle MySQL - MySQL Track Room - Percona Live 2021
Oracle MySQL Database Cloud Service 2021 - Where we are today&amp;hellip;
Early 2020 Oracle introduced the MySQL Database Service (MDS) built on Oracle Gen 2 Cloud Infrastructure and MySQL 8. It is 100% developed, managed, and supported by the Oracle MySQL team.

MySQL configuration has traditionally been done via system variables with values coming from either command line, config files or SET commands. This can be a security issue since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support a trust model rooted in some well known trusted state that cannot be modified by less trusted actors.
This is what the manifest le security model is aiming at solving.</description></item><item><title>Automating MariaDB Deployments With Ansible</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/6/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/6/</guid><description>Federico Razzoli - Vettabase - Percona Live 2021 - MariaDB Track Room
This demo shows how to deploy MariaDB with Ansible. We&amp;rsquo;ll look into the Ansible playbook and the Ansible commands to use to install MariaDB, upgrade MariaDB, and modify MariaDB configuration on any number of servers. The Playbook we&amp;rsquo;ll use is a realistic production installation: it includes scheduled backups and a PMM agent to monitor the server performance. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how using Ansible saves long work hours, makes operations virtually error-free, and provides a complete documentation of servers configuration.</description></item><item><title>MariaDB ColumnStore – A Columnar Storage Engine, First Class Citizen in MariaDB</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/5/</guid><description>Vicențiu Ciorbaru - MariaDB Foundation - Percona Live 2021 - MariaDB Track Room
MariaDB has had ColumnStore (a columnar storage engine) available for a while now. The problem was that ColumnStore (formerly known as InniDB) was coded in such a way that required a custom version of MariaDB to function. The installation was also non-trivial, with quite a set of dependencies needed. After a significant amount of work, both within MariaDB&amp;rsquo;s codebase and ColumnStore&amp;rsquo;s codebase, it is now possible with MariaDB 10.</description></item><item><title>Trino on Ice: Using Iceberg To Replace the Hive Table Format</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/altinity-room/10/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/altinity-room/10/</guid><description>Brian Olsen - Percona Live 2021 - Altinity Community Track
Trino (formerly PrestoSQL) is a ludicrously fast query engine that evolved from the need to replace the slow query turnaround speeds of the Hive engine. Trino grew in popularity under the label of Presto for years as an interactive query engine that lives over your data lake. While this operation was certainly a step away from the initial big data days of waiting hours to days for queries to complete, there were still many tedious rules engineers had to follow in order to correctly create, manage, and use their data in the datalake due to the Hive table format.</description></item><item><title>Fun and Games: Why We Picked ClickHouse To Drive Gaming Analytics at GiG</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/altinity-room/9/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/altinity-room/9/</guid><description>Stephen Borg - Matthew Formosa - Percona Live 2021 - Altinity Community Track
With such a saturated market for the iGaming industry, many technology providers are reviewing their architecture to provide a leaner, more sustainable platform. Complex architectures that involve heavy license and high maintenance costs were two of the rules to avoid when GiG kicked o R&amp;amp;D on what technology to choose at the heart of GiG Data. Tied with the necessity of good governance whilst empowering stakeholders needing real-time data, the list of databases became shorter and shorter.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Work and Leadership in the Time of Pandemics</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/4/</guid><description>Anna Widenius - MariaDB Foundation - Percona Live 2021 - MariaDB Track Room
Virtual work and leadership in the time of pandemics MariaDB Foundation has been a virtual organization long before the pandemic struck.

Digital transformation initiatives have unlocked large and fast-moving data sets including clickstreams, network telemetry, application monitoring and IoT devices. Analytics architectures have not kept pace, with most data still being run through existing “cold analytics” systems and tools designed for smaller and less time-sensitive workloads. “Hot analytics” denotes workloads where the responsiveness of the system is instantaneous and can support self-service data exploration, and where the data is extremely fresh, allowing for more informed decision-making.</description></item><item><title>Collaboration in Open Source: A Q&amp;A on Github, Jira, Zulip and Knowledgebase</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/2/</guid><description>Kaj Arnö, Ian Gilfillan, Robert Bindar, Vicențiu Ciorbaru, Anna Widenius - MariaDB Foundation - Percona Live 2021 - MariaDB Track Room
