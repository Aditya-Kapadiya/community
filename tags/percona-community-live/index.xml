As people use PostgreSQL for more and more projects, many of them are falling into the same traps, problems, and issues that many others have.</description></item><item><title>Database Resiliency</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-ravikumar-buragapu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-ravikumar-buragapu/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

Block device incidents are frequent and frightening in production. To achieve high availability, distributed databases usually have fault tolerant strategies to handle these incidents. As the system gets more complicated, it&amp;rsquo;s even hard to prove whether these strategies are working. For example, if the execution and distribution of scheduling commands also depend on the hanging storage, it will have no effect.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Indexing With Postgres</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-bruce-momjian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-bruce-momjian/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

We live in a dangerous world and a catastrophe can happen at any time, including in our database. We can have a hardware failure, software failure, malicious software, or a human error and find ourselves with a data loss. While we work hard to prevent all those some are just not under our control and we cannot rely on luck, we need strategy and methods to be able to recover the maximum data we can in case a catastrophic event happens and this is what we will discuss during this talk.</description></item><item><title>Liquibase Data: Version Control and Collaboration for the Database</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-robert-reeves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-robert-reeves/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.
